This is a D-Com Programmer for W0rld, Alpha Tools etc.

There are plenty of A-Com/D-Com Programmers out there, why should you buy this one?

⚡️collect them all⚡️ our D-Com comes in 4 collectible colors: red, orange, green and blue which all have sleek 'underfloor' lighting and feature exclusive artwork

⚡️smallest footprint⚡️ measuring just 50x50x6 mm (smaller than 2"x2"x1/4") this is one of the most portable D-Coms to be found anywhere

⚡️USB-C connector⚡️ away with those pesky Mini-USB cables and OTG Adapters. Just use the same cable you most likely already use to charge your phone or laptop and carry less stuff around

⚡️genuine parts and high build quality⚡️ It is no secret that the Arduino Nano clones most other D-Coms use often come with non-genuine parts and sometimes do not work reliably with all drivers. We only source genuine parts and the complete electronics manufacturing process takes place in ISO 9001 certified facilities

⚡️true D-Com⚡️ most programmers nowadays are really just A-Coms. This is great for reducing complexity and cost, but reduces compatibility with older devices. Our unique new true D-Com circuit performs like an original D-Com, but is smaller and almost as inexpensive as an A-Com.

This is really the next generation D-Com Programmer. Loaded with all the features you expect, and really being a true D-Com, not a cost-reduced A-Com, this device is the first of its kind to combine the whole programmer on a single circuit board. This enables the uniquely small design, high-reliability and the next generation USB-C connector.

Continuing the legacy of over 200 happy SD-Stick Programmer customers, we are happy to announce the launch of our new D-Com Programmer, featuring the same design detail, professional production and excellent support.

(USB-C cable and toy will not be included)

## SD-Stick and SD-Stick Programmer

![SD-Stick Programmer](https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/useruploads/display/ce5be0a5-86cc-4a90-9d98-885f8a75183a_photo_2022-02-27_14-57-04.jpg)

The SD-Stick is a nifty little device when you want to store a small bit of information but don't quite need the capacity of a micro sd card, or even a file system to begin with. It contains a Macronix MX25L3233F 32-Mbit NOR-Flash whose connections are brought out two a micro sd like interface. However, you will need the corresponding programmer to do anything useful, you can't simply insert it into your regular micro sd port. What will you do with your SD-Stick? - The possibilities are endless, the only limit is yourself.

This Programmer can be used to program the SD-Stick or SD-Stick Lites. It contains a CH341A chip and is compatible with all available software. It also has two indicator LEDs for Power/Operation. Make sure to insert the SD stick with the contacts facing down towards the circuit board!
